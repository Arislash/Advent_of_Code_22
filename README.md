# Advent_of_Code_22
This is a collection of my code for Advent of Code 2022

Its also my first managed repository on github which i am using to learn how it works. So if things are scuffed that it why :D

I ended up having to go away for some days after the first week or so, and never ended up finishing this. Might do it later if i have time

The assignments are found here https://adventofcode.com/2022
